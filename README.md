Career Guidance web Application PHP 

R IC H is a project which is based on career Guidance. Here admin manages all 
the center and student activities. A Career Guidance System where students can 
see various career opportunities shows various fields available after 
the SSLC. Next, the system allows users to give a test. It is a series of tests of 
various general questions. After test completion, a score is calculated for each test. 
Based on those results the system manipulates and calculates the best career for 
that student. This result is then emailed to that user and the system determines the 
distance between the Centre and the student. The system also consists of an admin 
module. The admin can manage all the activities in the system.
